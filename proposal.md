## DATA 551 PROJECT PROPOSAL

### Section 1: Motivation and Purpose

- **Our role:** Business Intelligence Analyst
- **Target audience:** Mobi by Rogers stakeholders

In collaboration with Rogers for Mobi, our Consultancy Firm aims to revolutionize bikeshare system management through the creation of an interactive Bikeshare Dashboard.

The motivation stems from the need for efficient decision-making in the dynamic world of bikeshare systems. Our Bikeshare Dashboard is not just a tool; it's a strategic compass guiding stakeholders through the intricate landscape of user behavior, operational patterns, and marketing opportunities. By addressing the absence of a dedicated platform for recent data, we aim to create a bikeshare experience that aligns with the values of connectivity and smart technology championed by Mobi by Rogers.

As we embark on this journey, our purpose is clear: empower stakeholders, elevate user experiences, and pedal towards a future where the Mobi by Rogers Bikeshare system stands as a beacon of efficiency and innovation. In a city known for its vibrant bikeshare culture, our dashboard aims to unlock a wealth of insights, allowing stakeholders to make informed decisions that resonate with the heartbeat of Vancouver's bikeshare landscape.

### Section 2: Description of the Data

Our Bikeshare Dashboard project is centered around a dataset from Mobi by Rogers, featuring an extensive 500,000 records of bikeshare usage within the last year (Jan 2023 - Jan 2024). This dataset includes crucial variables like departure and return timestamps, bike and electric bike details, station information, membership types, covered distance, duration, temperatures, and stopover metrics. Each record represents a specific bikeshare trip, offering a comprehensive snapshot of user behavior, operational trends, and environmental conditions. To streamline our visualizations, we'll focus on selected variables, allowing stakeholders to derive valuable insights from this extensive bikeshare dataset.
