## DATA 551 PROJECT PROPOSAL

#### Section 1: Motivation and Purpose

- **Our role:** Business Intelligence Analyst
- **Target audience:** Mobi by Rogers stakeholders

In collaboration with Rogers for Mobi, our Consultancy Firm aims to revolutionize bikeshare system management through the creation of an interactive Bikeshare Dashboard.

The motivation stems from the need for efficient decision-making in the dynamic world of bikeshare systems. Our Bikeshare Dashboard is not just a tool; it's a strategic compass guiding stakeholders through the intricate landscape of user behavior, operational patterns, and marketing opportunities. By addressing the absence of a dedicated platform for recent data, we aim to create a bikeshare experience that aligns with the values of connectivity and smart technology championed by Mobi by Rogers.

As we embark on this journey, our purpose is clear: empower stakeholders, elevate user experiences, and pedal towards a future where the Mobi by Rogers Bikeshare system stands as a beacon of efficiency and innovation. In a city known for its vibrant bikeshare culture, our dashboard aims to unlock a wealth of insights, allowing stakeholders to make informed decisions that resonate with the heartbeat of Vancouver's bikeshare landscape.

#### Section 2: Description of the Data

Our Bikeshare Dashboard project is centered around a dataset from Mobi by Rogers, featuring an extensive 500,000 records of bikeshare usage within the last year (Jan 2023 - Jan 2024). This dataset includes crucial variables like departure and return timestamps, bike and electric bike details, station information, membership types, covered distance, duration, temperatures, and stopover metrics. Each record represents a specific bikeshare trip, offering a comprehensive snapshot of user behavior, operational trends, and environmental conditions. To streamline our visualizations, we'll focus on selected variables, allowing stakeholders to derive valuable insights from this extensive bikeshare dataset.

#### Section 3: Research Questions and Usage Scenarios

**User Story:** Sarah, Operational Manager at Mobi by Rogers

**Context:** Sarah's objective is to enhance the bikeshare system at Mobi by Rogers by understanding user behavior, operational trends, and spatial dynamics.

**Tasks:**
1. Sarah enters the Bikeshare Dashboard and navigates to the second page, where the Historical Bike Availability Map awaits. She selects the geospatial density plot view to gain a comprehensive understanding of bike availability trends across Vancouver. Utilizing the bike type filter, she narrows her focus to electric bikes only, aiming to discern specific patterns in electric bike usage.
2. Intrigued by the spatial insights, Sarah further refines her exploration by choosing specific station names in the filter options, honing in on high-traffic areas like Bute & Davie and Glen & Union. This spatial exploration aids her in identifying potential station expansion opportunities and optimizing bike availability at popular locations.
3. Sarah seamlessly switches to the third page, where the line chart visualizations await. She focuses on the chart depicting the number of bikes used over time, opting to filter by membership tiers. By selecting the '365 Day Pass plus' filter, she observes trends specific to long-term subscribers, potentially revealing usage patterns that inform targeted marketing efforts or tailored incentives.
4. Equipped with insights from both the Historical Bike Availability Map and line charts, Sarah identifies a correlation between the popularity of electric bikes in certain areas and the seasonal preferences of long-term subscribers. This prompts her to strategize the introduction of promotional campaigns for '365 Day Pass plus' members during peak seasons in these areas.

This scenario showcases how the Historical Bike Availability Map's geospatial density plot, combined with targeted filters, and the line chart visualizations with membership tier filtering, can empower operational managers like Sarah to derive nuanced insights, optimize resource allocation, and enhance bikeshare experiences within the Mobi by Rogers system.
