# Milestone 2 Reflection

In developing the CycleSync Bikeshare Dashboard, we successfully implemented several key features and functionalities that enhance the user experience and provide valuable insights into bikeshare patterns in Vancouver. The project leveraged data from Mobi by Rogers, a prominent bikeshare company in the region, focusing on ride statistics, station analyses, and temporal trends.
