# Development Workflow

## Introduction

Welcome to the development workflow guide for our package. This document outlines the procedures and best practices for contributing to the development of the package. By following this workflow, you can ensure a smooth and efficient collaboration process.

## Version Control

We use Git for version control. The main repository for the project is hosted on GitHub at [Project](https://github.com/cmulya/DATA551-Project). Contributors should clone the repository to their local machine and work on feature branches.

## Branching Strategy

We follow a branching strategy to manage development work:

- `main`: The main branch is the stable branch containing production-ready code. All development work should be based on feature branches.
- Feature Branches: Contributors should create feature branches from the `main` branch for each new feature or bug fix. Branch names should be descriptive and prefixed with `feature/` or `bugfix/`.

## Pull Requests

When a feature or bug fix is complete, contributors should create a pull request (PR) to merge their changes into the `main` branch. PRs should include:

- A descriptive title and summary of the changes.
- Any related issue references.
- Properly formatted and documented code.
- Passing tests.

## Code Review

All PRs require at least one code review before merging. Reviewers should ensure that:

- The code follows the project's coding standards and style guidelines.
- The changes address the stated issue or feature requirements.
- Tests adequately cover the changes, and documentation is updated if necessary.

## Conclusion

Following this development workflow will help maintain consistency, quality, and stability in the project. If you have any questions or need assistance, feel free to reach out to the project maintainers.
